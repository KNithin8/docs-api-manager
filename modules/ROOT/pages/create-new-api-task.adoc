You can create a new API instance by uploading an API definition from your computer. +

. Log in to your Anypoint platform, and click *API Manager*.
. In the *API Administration* tab, select *Manage API* and *Create New API*.

+
. Use the *Name* field to enter the name for your API definition asset.
. Use the *Asset Types* drop-down menu to select the type of API definition. +
* REST-API OAS
* SOAP-API WSDL
* HTTP API
+
NOTE: OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, with the exception of the callback feature. To work around this issue, handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use a OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
+
. In the *File Upload* field, click *Choose file* and select an API definition file from your drive to upload.
* If you want to upload a  _REST API - OAS_ asset type, you should upload a `.json` or `.yaml` file.
* If you want to upload a  _SOAP API - WSDL_  asset type, you should upload a `.wsdl` or `.xml` file.
+
You can upload your API definition compressed in a ZIP file. When uploading a ZIP file, make sure it contains at least one main file in the root directory, and select the main file using the *Main File* field.
+
Additionally, you can click the *Advanced* click, to edit the _GroupId_, _AssetId_ and _Version_ of the asset you are uploading.
. Click *Continue*. +
This uploads your API definition to Exchange and takes you to the Endpoint configuration screen. +
Learn how to configure the endpoint for your API instance following the instructions in the xref:configure-api-task.adoc[Configuring an API instance Endpoint on API Manager] section.
. After configuring your endpoint, click *Save*.
