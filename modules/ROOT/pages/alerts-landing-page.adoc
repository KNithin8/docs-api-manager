The main purpose of notification monitoring is to alert you about unusual behavior or performance. Anypoint Platform supports three types of notifications: API alerts, contracts alerts, and runtime alerts.

== API Alerts
 
You can configure alerts that flag unusual API-specific behavior, such as if the response time of an API is greater than 60 seconds, or if the number of API requests in 30 seconds is greater than 1000. You create and configure API alerts by adding alerts to an API instance in API Manager. See xref:add-api-alert-task.adoc[Adding an API Alert].

Add one of the following types of alerts to an API instance:

* Policy violation
+
An infraction of one or more policies that govern the API occurs.

* Request Count
+
Users request access to the API more times than allowed in a specified interval of time.
+
Time interval values are in the range 1 - 999999999. The intervals are implemented as sliding windows, not absolute minute boundaries, to prevent data burst problems.

* Response Code
+
The API returns one of these HTTP codes upon receiving a request: 400, 401, 403, 404, 408, 500, 502, or 503

* Response Time
+
The response time of the API exceeds a specified period. 

API Manager triggers API alerts only when states change. However the first occurrence of a changed state may be undetected because states are undefined for newly created alerts.

When you configure an API alert, you select users in your Business Group who can receive email notifications about the alert. The notification includes information about events that trigger the alert as specified by the level of severity. Users receive two emails:

* One email describes the alert. For example:
+
`Your API, CesarDemoAPI - Basic:151 (Environment: "NewOne"), has received greater than 2 requests within 1 consecutive periods of 1 minutes.`
+
* Another email notifies you when the alert is resolved.
+
`Your API Version, jsonplaceholderapi - 1.0.development, is no longer in an alert state. The number of policy violations was not greater than 1 in the last 1 consecutive periods of 1 minutes.`

After an alert is triggered, API Manager sends the first set of two notification emails, and stops listening for alerts until the next alert period begins. This technique prevents repetitive notification emails.
