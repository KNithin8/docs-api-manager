In API Manager 2.x, you can use instances of an API in multiple environments. Additionally, you can have multiple instances in the same environment. 

You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint. You can apply caching policies (for example, to the proxy), and throttling and security policies to the basic endpoint.

After setting up an API version for management, you repeat the process to create another instance. Attempting to set up the same version creates another instance of the version. You can create multiple instances and expand the version information to view details about them.

To create a API instance:

. Select *API Administration > Manage API* to create an API instance from Exchange.
+
For example, to set up version 1.0 of an API named `jsonplaceholder`:
+

+
. From *API Name*, select the API (`jsonplaceholder`).
+
NOTE: OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is currently not supported in API Manager. You must convert the API to RAML or OAS 2.0 to manage it using API Manager. For converting the specifications to OAS 2.0, you must use third-party tools, such as APImatic.
+
. From *API Version*, select version (`1.0`).
. From *Asset Version*, select the Exchange asset version.
. From *Managing Type*, choose *Basic Endpoint* or *Endpoint with Proxy*. 
+
For this example, select *Endpoint With Proxy*.
. In *Implementation URI*, enter the URL that hosts your web site or an arbitrary URL, such as the example shown (`+http://api.domain.com+`). 
+
If you choose _Endpoint with Proxy_ and do not make an entry (such as accepting the default value), you cannot save your configuration.
. From *Client provider*, select the IdP that you want to use to authenticate access to this API from registered client applications:
+
.Associate client provider with the API

+
<1> The *Tag* field.
<2> The *Managing Type* field. Select *Endpoint With Proxy*.
<3> The *Client provider* field is at the bottom of the API Configuration section.
+
If no client providers are set up for your environment and organization, this field is not visible.
. Select a proxy deployment target, for example, CloudHub.
. Accept the default path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path.
. Save, or optionally set advanced options, and then save.
. In Advanced Options, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy, or accept the default label, and set a response timeout.
+
. Return to the API administration dashboard: Click *API Administration*.
+
In the Version column, the instance indicator appears beside the version name.
+
. Expand the version.
+
The instance information appears:
