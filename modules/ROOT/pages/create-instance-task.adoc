In API Manager 2.x, instances of an API can exist in multiple environments. Additionally, you can create multiple instances of an API in the same environment. 

An example: 

* Create an instance of an API and configure it as a proxy. Apply caching policies to this proxy. 

* Then, create an API instance to manage directly as a basic endpoint. Apply throttling and security policies to this basic endpoint. 

* After configuring an API version for management, repeat the process to create another API instance. Specifying the same version creates another API instance of the version. 

* Finally, create multiple API instances and click the version information to view API details.

The following procedure describes creating an API instance from Exchange, and configuring the API instance as an endpoint with proxy.

== Create an API instance

. From *API Administration*, click *Manage API*. 
. Select *Manage API From Exchange*.
+
To configure version 1.0 of an example API named `jsonplaceholder`:
+

+
. From *API name*, enter `jsonplaceholder`.
+
NOTE: OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 3.0 is supported, with the exception of the callback feature. To work around this issue, handle the callback outside of the Mule runtime engine domain or use an OAS 3.0 specification that does not use callbacks.
+
. From *API version*, select version (`1.0`).
. From *Asset version*, select the Exchange asset version.
. From *Managing type*, select *Endpoint with proxy*.
. In *Implementation URI*, enter your web site URL or an arbitrary URL, such as `+http://api.domain.com+`. 
+
If you choose _Endpoint with Proxy_ and do not make an entry (such as accepting the default value), you cannot save your configuration.
. From *Client provider*, select the client provider to authenticate API access from registered client applications:
+
.Associate client provider with the API

+
* The first item under API Configuration is the *Add a Tag* field.
* The second item shows the *Managing Type* field. Select *Endpoint With Proxy*.
* The third item shows the *Client provider* field. 
+
If no client providers are configured for your environment and organization, the *Client provider* field is not visible.

. Select a proxy deployment target, for example, CloudHub.
. Accept the default path `/` for the proxy endpoint or enter another path.
. In *Advanced options*, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy (or accept the default label), and set a response timeout.
. Click *Save*.
+
. Click *API Administration* to return to the API Administration dashboard.
+
In the *Version* column, the instance indicator appears beside the version name.
+
. Expand the version.
+
The instance information appears:
