|===

The OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy restricts access to a protected resource by allowing only those HTTP requests that provide a valid Oauth2 token belonging to a client application with API access. OpenID Connect Access token Enforcement policy does not generate tokens but only validates them.

[NOTE]
This policy is only available for an organization that is configured to use the xref:access-management::configure-client-management-openid-task.adoc[OpenID Connect as a Client Management solution].  

[[how-this-policy-works]]
== How This Policy Works

The following diagram illustrates the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy workflow:

image:open-id-policy-workflow.png[OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement Workflow]

. The user sends an HTTP request to the API protected by the policy. 
. Policy extracts the token from the request and sends it to the validation endpoint to verify the integrity of the token.
. Token validation endpoint returns metadata of the token, including the client ID of the client application.
. Using local contract credentials that was previously obtained from Anypoint Platform, the policy verifies whether the client ID has access to the API. 
. If all the validations are successfully completed, the request is allowed to reach the backend.

[[leveraging-TVE-information]]
=== Leveraging Token Validation Endpoint Information for Mule Applications

When a token validation endpoint successfully validates a token, certain information, such as configurable fields from OpenID Connect are returned to the policy.

The following example illustrates the token validation response from the authorization server:

[source,text,linenums]
---
{
    "uid":"john.doe",
    "mail":"john.doe@example.com"
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "expires_in":3600
}
---

The fields returned by the OAuth provider are processed by the policy, propagated throughout the Mule flow, and finally exposed to the backend if the application requesting the access uses an HTTP requester.

=== Token Caching

After the system validates a token, it is cached (by default) until it expires, to improve the performance of the policy. In certain cases, such as in the case of revoked tokens, you might want to minimize or even disable caching.

To control the token-cached time before retrying a validation against the token validation endpoint, specify the following property when starting the Mule runtime engine:

`anypoint.platform.max_federation_expiration_time=<expiration time in seconds; specify 0 to disable caching>`

Alternatively, you can also specify this parameter in the `wrapper.conf` file.
 
To control the number of tokens that can be cached simultaneously, specify the following property when starting the Mule runtime engine:
 
`anypoint.platform.openid_connect_cache_max_size=<amount of tokens to be cached; default value is 10.000>`

Alternatively, you can also specify this parameter in the `wrapper.conf` file.

[[token-validation-endpoint-authentication]]
=== Token Validation Endpoint Authentication

To complete validating the provided token, the policy sends a request to the validation endpoint. The policy then obtains the credentials from the client provider configuration (Token Introspection Client section) in Access management. These credentials are sent in the request body, as specified in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3[Client Authentication section of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework specification]. 

Other authentication methods for the token validation endpoint are currently not supported.

== Configuring the Expose Headers Option

If you configured the `Expose Headers` option in the policy, the application (for example, out-of-the-box proxies) uses the HTTP requester to redirect the properties to the backend as headers. 

For each field, the original request to the protected resource is enriched with the HTTP headers using the format: X-AGW- + <key>=<value>. For the example response from the previous section, the following headers will be added:

[source,text,linenums]
---
X-AGW-uid=john.doe
X-AGW-mail=john.doe@example.com
X-AGW-token_type=Bearer
X-AGW-expires_in=3600
---

For further processing within the flow, the original unparsed response from the validation endpoint is made available. The information is stored in an authentication object. 

For example, suppose a `"mail`" field is returned to the policy, you can access the value of the field by using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression:

`#[authentication.properties.userProperties.mail]`

You can obtain the client ID of the OAuth2 token by using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression:

`#[authentication.principal]`

== Communicating With the Token Validation Endpoint Using a Proxy

You can enable the OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement policy to use the gateway proxy settings by specify the following property when starting the Mule runtime engine: 

`anypoint.platform.external_authentication_provider_enable_proxy_settings=<true|false(default)>`

When you enable this property, the policy uses the Mule proxy settings, if you have specified the following parameters:

* `anypoint.platform.proxy_host=localhost`
* `anypoint.platform.proxy_port=8080`

== Configuring Policy Parameters

When you apply the policy to your API from the UI, a list of parameters are displayed based on whether your environment includes Mule or xref:service-mesh::index.adoc[Non-Mule application managed by Anypoint Service Mesh].

=== Configuring the Parameters for Mule Applications

For Mule applications, the following parameters are displayed based on whether your environment includes Mule applications:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="30,40,30"]
|===
| Element | Description | Example
| Scopes | A space-separated list of supported scopes. | READ, WRITE, READ and WRITE 
| Scope Validation Criteria | Determines if the token must contain all defined scopes or just one.
Values: `Contains all scopes` and `Contains any scope` | 
In this example, the value `READ,WRITE` was selected for the scope element.
If the ‘Contains all scopes’ value is selected, the tokens with the scopes `READ` and `WRITE` are accepted. If the ‘Contains any scopes’ value is selected, the tokens with the scope `READ, WRITE, and READ, WRITE` are accepted. 
| Validate TLS Certificate | Enables third-party authentication server TLS validation. | If selected, the communication with the token validation endpoint uses the TLS protocol.
| Expose Headers | In a proxy scenario, defines if headers should be exposed in the request to the backend. User properties returned by the federation server are sent as headers to the backend with the 'X-AGW-' prefix. | See the <<leveraging-TVE-information,Leveraging Token Validation Endpoint Information for Mule Applications>> for more information about this field.
| Skip Client Id Validation | Skips client application's API contract validation. | If selected, the step 4 of the diagram in the <<how-this-policy-works,How This Policy Works>> section is skipped.
|===

=== Configuring the Parameters for Non-Mule Applications (Anypoint Service Mesh)

For (non-Mule applications that are managed by Anypoint Service Mesh, you configure the OpenID Connect OAuth 2.0 Token Enforcement policy in the same way, excluding the following differences:

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="30,40,30"]
|===
| Element | Description | Example
| Scopes | A space-separated list of supported scopes. | READ, WRITE, READ and WRITE
| Skip Client Id Validation | Skips client application's API contract validation. | If selected, the step 4 of the diagram in the <<how-this-policy-works,How This Policy Works>> section is skipped.

== FAQs

*The OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy does not appear in the list of policies to apply to the API.*

If the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy  does not appear in the policies list, ensure that you have configured the OpenID client provider in Access Management. For information, see xref:access-management::configure-client-management-openid-task.adoc[Configure OpenID Connect Client Management]. If you are using xref:configure-multiple-credential-providers.adoc[multiple IdPs], check that the API has the OpenID connect client configured.


*Can I generate OAuth2 tokens with the policy?*

No. The policy only validates the tokens.

*OpenID Connect validation endpoint is rejecting the requests sent by the policy.*

See the validation endpoint documentation provided by the OpenID connect server and verify whether the authentication method described in the <<token-validation-endpoint-authentication,Token Validation Endpoint Authentication>> section is supported.


*How does the policy manage the credentials to communicate with the validation endpoint?*

This information is part of the policy configuration and is stored on a disk. If you want this information to be stored with encryption, xref:api-gateway-encryption-mule4.adoc[configure gateway encryption in your runtime]. 


*How are the OAuth tokens cached?*

Oauth2 tokens are cached only in memory and are never written to disk.


*Does the policy communicate with the Anypoint Platform on a per request basis?*

No, the policy uses client applications previously retrieved by the Mule runtime engine.
This enables the policy to continue working even if the connection with the Management plane is lost. If you want the client application information that is written on disk to be encrypted, xref:api-gateway-encryption-mule4.adoc[configure gateway encryption in your runtime].


*Can I configure Rate-Limiting SLA policy after I configure the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy?*

Yes, you can. Apply the Rate-Limiting SLA policy after the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy and provide the `Client ID Expression` using the following DataWeave 2.0 expression: 

`#[authentication.principal]`

Because the identity of the requester is already validated by the OpenID Connect Access Token Enforcement policy, you can leave the `Client Secret Expression` field empty.
