= Exporting an API Instance on API Manager

After creating an API instance, you can export it. You can then import it into API Manager to create a new API instance. 

The export file is created as follows:

* Content: API instance endpoint configuration and Exchange asset relationship
* File format: ZIP
* File name format: {API name}-{version}-{API instance ID}
* File size: 100MB or smaller ZIP file

Information that is not exported with the API instance includes:

* *The associated client provider configuration*: This is not exported with the API instance because it is extracted from the target environment when the API instance is imported. 
* *Information such as contracts, policies, and API specifications*: These are stored in the asset. If you need to export this information, you can instead promote the API instance in an API group. 

To export an API instance:

. Go to *Anypoint Platform* > *API Manager*.
. In *API Administration*, click the name of the API you want to export. 
+
The API *Settings* detail appears:

. Select *Actions* > *Export API*.

Your API instance is now successfully exported.
