You can apply a policy to the entire API (default) or to specific methods and resources of an API. 

== Prerequisites

Before you apply a default policy, ensure that:

* Mule runtime engine (Mule) is installed with xref:api-gateway-capabilities-mule4.adoc[API gateway capabilities] enabled.
* An xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API] configured with a basic endpoint or a proxy endpoint exists in API Manager.
* A Mule application is deployed with a xref:connectors::http/http-listener-ref.adoc[HTTP(s) based flow], which is linked to the API through Autodiscovery.
+
When Autodiscovery is correctly configured in your Mule application, your applicationâ€™s API is said to be tracked by or paired to API Manager.

Autogenerated proxies handle these prerequisites in most cases. API gateway reconciles the automated policies applied to an API in API Manager during runtime.

== Apply a Policy

To apply a policy:

* Go to *API Manager > API Administration* and select the API instance from the details window.
* From the left navigation, select *Policies > Apply New Policy*.
