As Organization Administrator of the master organization, you can revoke and delete an application to which you previously gave access to your API. 

Before you delete a contract, you must first revoke it. Deleting a contract deletes any granted access to that contract from the API Exchange portal.

To delete a contract with an application:

. In API Manager, click *API Administration*.
. Click the API Name of the API instance that you need to access. 
. Click the `<api version>:<api instance>` link, for example, "v1:16046365". 
. From the configuration page for the API instance, click *Contracts* from the left menu.
.
. For the application to which you want to revoke access, click *Revoke*.
