The DataGraph Administration tab for a particular environment appears only after you have added at least one API schema to that environment's unified schema.

As a DataGraph administrator:

* Use the xref:datagraph-settings.adoc[DataGraph Administration Settings page] to select environments, view and edit endpoints, configure policies, and configure client providers.

* Manage xref:datagraph-managing-contracts.adoc[Contracts] to ensure that only authorized client applications can consume the unified schema.

* Manage xref:datagraph-adding-sla-tiers.adoc[SLA tiers] for each DataGraph instance.

* Use the xref:datagraph-viewing-application-contracts.adoc[API Manager Client Applications] page to view and manage client application contracts.
