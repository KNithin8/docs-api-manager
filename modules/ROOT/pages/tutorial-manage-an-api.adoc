= Applying an SLA-Based Policy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In this procedure, you configure and apply a rate limiting SLA-based policy to an API. You create the following two access SLA tiers that limit the number of app requests, based on the SLA level of the app:

* A tier that limits requests to three per minute, with no approval required
* A tier that limits requests to five per minute, with API Versions Owner approval required

When an app attempts to consume the protected API resource, the rate limiting SLA-based policy is enforced. Because this policy is client ID-based, app requests must include the expected client ID. The client secret is optional.

== Add the Required RAML Snippet

SLA-based rate limiting requires adding a RAML or OAS snippet to your API. This procedure demonstrates adding a RAML snippet.

. For optimal security, specify the client ID and secret as headers. 
+
Add a section called `traits:` at the RAML root level to define headers:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  client-id-required:
    headers:
      client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----

. Add the `client-id-required` trait to every method that requires these headers:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/users:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
----

. xref:design-center::design-publish.adoc[Publish the API to Exchange]

== Add the SLA Tier

With the required RAML snippet added to your RAML API, you now add the SLA tier.

. From API Manager, navigate to *API Administration* and select the API instance.
. Click *Change API Specification* via the *Actions* button. 
. Select the newly published API version and click *Change*.
. Verify that the API *Type* is either RAML/OAS or HTTP.
. Click *SLA Tiers*.
. Select *Add SLA Tier* and specify a limit on the tier:
+
* Name: Free
* Approval: Automatic
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 3
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute
+
. Click *Add SLA Tier* again and specify another limit on the tier:
+
* Name: Premium
* Approval: Manual
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 5
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute

== Apply the Policy

After adding the SLA tier, the policy can now be applied to the API.

. Select *Policies*.
. Click *Apply New Policy* and select *Rate limiting - SLA-based*.
. Click *Configure Policy*.
. Configure the policy on the API `/users` resource:
* In *Method & Resource Conditions*, select *Apply Configurations to Specific Methods & Resources*.
* Under *Methods*, select GET.
* Under *URI Template Regex*, enter `/users` to apply rate limiting only to the `/users` resource, or enter `.*` to apply rate limiting to every resource URI of the API.
* If your environment uses Mule 4, configure header propagation for exposing the rate limiting headers and rate limiting policies by checking the *Expose Headers* checkbox. For additional information, see the FAQ section of xref:rate-limiting.adoc[Reviewing Rate Limiting Policy].
* Click *Apply*.

If a RAML spec is attached to your API, click *Preview resource matching* to verify which resources your filters affect.

== Next Steps
* Register a client application to access the API with the newly applied policy:
. xref:exchange::to-request-access.adoc[Request Access from Exchange]
. xref:manage-client-apps-latest-task.adoc[Approve Access]
. xref:access-client-app-id-task.adoc[Obtain the Client Credentials of the Registered Client Application]
* Deploy the application:
** xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploy to CloudHub]
* Test using a tool such as Advanced REST Client, making sure to populate the request's `client_id` and `client_secret` header fields with the client credentials obtained above.
