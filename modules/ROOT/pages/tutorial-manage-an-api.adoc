= Applying an SLA-Based Policy
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In this procedure, you configure and apply a rate limiting SLA-based policy to an API. You create the following two access SLA tiers that limit the number of app requests, based on the SLA level of the app:

* A tier that limits requests to three per minute, with no approval required
* A tier that limits requests to five per minute, with API Versions Owner approval required

When an app attempts to consume the protected API resource, the rate limiting SLA-based policy is enforced. Because this policy is client ID-based, app requests must include the expected user name and password. 

== Add the Required RAML Snippet

SLA-based rate limiting requires adding a RAML snippet to your RAML API. In an API instance list of applied policies, a link to RAML snippets is required for the policy to appear.

. Specify the client ID and secret as query parameters. 
+
Add a section called `traits:` at the RAML root level to define query parameters:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
traits:
  - client-id-required:
      queryParameters:
       client_id:
        type: string
      client_secret:
        type: string
----

. Add the `client-id-required` trait to every method that requires these query parameters:
+
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
/users:
  get:
    is: [client-id-required]
    description: Gets a list of JSONPlaceholder users.
----

== Add the SLA Tier

With the required RAML snippet added to your RAML API, you now add the SLA tier.

. From API Manager, navigate to *API Administration* and select an API instance.
. Verify that the API *Type* is either RAML/OAS or HTTP.
. Click *SLA Tiers*.
. Select *Add SLA Tier* and specify a limit on the tier:
+
* Name: Free
* Approval: Automatic
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 3
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute
+
. Click *Add SLA Tier* again and specify another limit on the tier:
+
* Name: Premium
* Approval: Manual
* Limits
** # of Reqs: 5
** Time Period: 1
** Time Unit: Minute

== Apply the Policy

After adding the SLA tier, the policy can now be applied to the API.

. Select *Policies*.
. Click *Apply New Policy* and select *Rate limiting - SLA-based*.
. Click *Configure Policy*.
. In *Limits*, set the number of requests, time period, and units of measurement.
. Configure the policy on the API `/users` resource:
* In *Method & Resource Conditions*, select *Apply Configurations to Specific Methods & Resources*.
* Under *Methods*, select GET.
* Under *URI Template Regex*, enter `/users` to apply rate limiting only to the `/users` resource, or enter `.*` to apply rate limiting to every resource URI of the API.
* If your environment uses Mule 4, configure header propagation for token enforcement and rate limiting policies by checking the *Expose Headers* checkbox.
* Click *Apply*.

If a RAML spec is attached to your API, click *Preview resource matching* to verify which resources your filters affect.
