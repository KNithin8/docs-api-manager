If your business requirements change, you might want to modify an API Group by adding new API instances to it. To cover new scenarios, you might want to add a new API instance. 

You can also version an existing instance to add customizations. If a service is no longer required, you can remove the respective API instance that supports the service. However, modifying API Groups and API Group instances involves specific <<restrictions,restrictions>>.

When you publish an API Group in Exchange, the <<exchange_status,status>> of the API Group changes based on specific scenarios. 

[[restrictions]]
== Restrictions for Modifying API Group and Instances

Before you modify an API Group, ensure that you carefully review the restrictions:

* Add new instances of APIs that already exist in the group only if the API Group instance has no contracts. 
* Add only API instances that belong to the same identity provider (IdP). 
+
You cannot mix IdPs in an API Group instance.
* Add API instances but not APIs if:
** The API Group instance is published.
** The API Group version is published.
** The API Group version has multiple API Group instances.

[[exchange_status]]
== Exchange Status Based on API Group Transactions

The Exchange status of an API Group depends on these conditions:

* If your API Group is published in Exchange, your Exchange asset displays the new API instance. 
* If the API instance you added is related to an asset that is already linked to the Exchange API Groups asset, the API instance displays these details.
* If the API instance you added belongs to a new asset that is not yet liked to the Exchange API Groups asset, customers must create a new version of the API Groups asset.

== Task Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

* At least one API instance in your organization or business group
+
Otherwise, you will not be able to find the required organization or business group in the list.
* API Group Administrator permissions to add API instances to an API Group
