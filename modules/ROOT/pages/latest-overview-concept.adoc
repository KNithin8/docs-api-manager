Anypoint API Manager (API Manager) is a component of Anypoint Platform that enables you to manage, govern, and secure APIs. It leverages the runtime capabilities of API Gateway and Anypoint Service Mesh, both of which enforce policies, collect and track analytics data, manage proxies, provide encryption and authentication, and manage applications.

API Manager is tightly integrated with the following tools:

* xref:design-center::index.adoc[Anypoint Design Center (Design Center)], for specifying the structure of the API
* xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange (Exchange)], for storing and publishing API assets
* xref:studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio (Studio)], for implementing the API
* xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Manager (Runtime Manager)], to deploy, manage, and monitor the API (or proxy)

Before using API Manager, familiarize yourself with the user interface and the tasks you can perform therein.

== User Interface

Logging in to Anypoint Platform and selecting *API Manager* from the main menu navigates you to the following page:

image::api-manager-ui-overview.png[80%,80%]

<1> The environment selector is displayed at the top left of the API Administration page.
+
Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications. API Manager displays all environments except design environments.
+
For details, see xref:switch-environment-task.adoc[Switching Environments].

<2> You can select an option from the left navigation menu:
** *API Groups*
+
An API Group is an API asset that enables organizations to publish a group of API instances as a single unit. 
+
For details, see xref:api-groups-landing-page.adoc[API Groups].
** *Automated Policies* 
+
With policy automation, security architects and administrators can secure and govern every API running in an environment. 
+
For details, see xref:automated-policies-landing-page.adoc[Automated Policies].
** *Client Applications*
+
Applications are external services that consume APIs. 
+
For details, see xref:view-api-contracts.adoc[View API Instance Contracts].
** *Custom Policies*
+
Custom Policies are policies that anyone can develop and apply to their APIs, with the intention of extending existing functionality or defining new functionality.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Custom Policies* option is only available for Mule 3 custom policies. Mule 4 custom policies are available in Exchange.
====
+
For details, see xref:custom-policy-getting-started.adoc[Getting started with Custom Policies development].
** *Analytics*
+
API Analytics provide insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. 
+
For details, see xref:viewing-api-analytics.adoc[Reviewing Analytics Usage].

<3> The *Manage API* button enables you to add API instances.
+
You add an API previously published to Exchange. Or you add an API by uploading a RAML/OAS/SOAP definition. Additionally, you can add an API instance by importing a configuration ZIP file previously exported from API Manager.
+
For details, see xref:getting-started-proxy.adoc[Getting Started with Managing an API].

<4> Click the *Promote from environment* button to promote an API from any environment to the current environment.
+
For details, see xref:promote-api-task.adoc[Promoting an API Instance to Another Environment].

<5> Search for managed APIs via the API search field.
+
Searches are case-sensitive. Filter search results by selecting *All*, *Favorites* or *Active*.

<6> Click the *Environment information* button to display a dialog with information about the current environment, such as environment credentials.
+
You use environment credentials to provision the Anypoint Service Mesh adapter, or to configure Studio to sync with your environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Environment information* button is only available to administrators.
====

<7> The API version is displayed for each API. 
+
Clicking the API version number navigates you to the API *Settings* view, where you manage the following:
+
** *Alerts*
+
For details, see xref:using-api-alerts.adoc[Reviewing Alerts Concepts].
** *Contracts*
+
For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].
** *Policies*
+
For details, see xref:policies-landing-page.adoc[Policies].
** *SLA Tiers*
+
For details, see xref:defining-sla-tiers.adoc[Reviewing SLA Tiers Concepts].

<8> The registration status of each API is displayed.
+
Possible values are *Active*, *Inactive*, *Deploying*, and *Unregistered*. 
+
A status of *Unregistered* means that Anypoint Platform has never tracked the endpoint for this API version. Either you have entered a URL for an API or proxy that is not yet deployed, or you have declared an endpoint that is hosted somewhere other than an API Gateway and need to proxy that endpoint so that the platform can track it.
+
The endpoint must be tracked *Active* by Anypoint Platform in order for governance policies and SLA tiers to function.

<9> The number of contracted client applications is displayed for each API.
+
For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].


== Basic Concepts

=== Policies
Policies enable you to enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve adaptability of your APIs. For example, a policy can control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA).

API Manager supports the following types of policies:

* Default Policies
* Custom Policies

For details, see xref:policies-landing-page.adoc[Policies].

=== SLA Tiers
Service Level Access (SLA) tiers are categories of user access that you define for an API. The tier definition combined with an SLA-based policy determines whether access to the API at a certain level requires your approval. The tier definition also can limit the number of requests an application can make to the API. To enforce SLA tiers, you need to apply a rate-limiting or throttling policy that is SLA-based.

For details, see xref:defining-sla-tiers.adoc[Reviewing SLA Tiers Concepts].

=== Client Providers (Identity Providers)
You use client providers to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. Client providers authorize client applications. 

For details, see xref:configure-multiple-credential-providers.adoc[Configure Multiple Client Providers for Client Management].

=== Contracts
Contracts are created between client applications and API instances. A client application requests access in Exchange. The owner of the API instance approves the request in API Manager (or the approval is automatic, depending on configuration). When the request has been approved, the client application is registered.

Contracts are enforced with either of the following:

* SLA enforcement policies
* Client enforcement policies

For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].

=== API Alerts
An API alert (different from a Runtime Manager alert) is an alarm that flags one of the following:

* The API request violates a policy
* Requests received by the API exceed a given number within a period of time
* The API returns a specified HTTP error code
* The API response time exceeds a certain amount

API Manager triggers alerts when states change from desirable to undesirable or vice versa. When an alert triggers, API Manager sends email notifications to you and to others, if configured.

For details, see xref:using-api-alerts.adoc[Alerts].

=== API Assets
API assets, published by Exchange, are the components that comprise applications. Components include any of the following:

* APIs (OAS, RAML, RAML fragments, HTTP, WSDL, and Custom)
* API Groups
* Policies
* Examples
* Templates
* Modules
* Connectors owned by MuleSoft or your organization

For details, see xref:exchange::about-sharing-assets.adoc[Share Assets].

=== API Groups
An API Group is an API asset that enables organizations to publish a group of API instances as a single unit, so that applications can access the APIs as a group using one client ID. API Groups are created in API Manager and published to Exchange.

For details, see xref:api-groups-landing-page.adoc[API Groups].

=== API Instances
Instances of an API can exist in multiple environments. Additionally, you can create multiple instances of an API in the same environment.

The API Manager dashboard shows key information about a deployed API instance:

image::dashboard-legend.png[]

For details, see xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API Instance].

=== Autodiscovery Schemes
Through the Autodiscovery scheme, API Manager can track the API throughout the life cycle as you modify, version, deploy, govern, and publish it.

=== Business Groups
A system administrator groups individuals within an organization into business groups. Each group has its own Exchange API assets, and its own environments.

For details, see xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[Business Groups].

=== Environments
Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications. These environments are independent from each other and enable you to test your applications under the same conditions as your production environment.

The support for environments in strategic components of Anypoint Platform eliminates the need to construct version names to reflect an environment. Restricting access to and managing environments is also simplified. Permissions to access APIs are environment-based.

For details, see xref:access-management::environments.adoc[Environments].
