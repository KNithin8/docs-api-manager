API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing, governing, and securing APIs. The component leverages the runtime capabilities of API Gateway, which enforces policies, collects and tracks analytics data, manages proxies, provides industry standard encryption and authentications, and manages applications.

API Manager is tightly integrated with the following tools:

* Design Center for specifying the structure of the API
* Exchange for storing and publishing API assets
* Studio for implementing the API
+
Using Autodiscovery, API changes made in Studio are synchronized with the API registered in other tools, such as Design Center and API Manager.

The following diagram outlines a typical relationship between the tools:

image::hello-world-flow-diagram.png[40%,40%]

. Build your RAML or OAS API specification in Design Center.
. Publish the API specification from Design Center to Exchange.
. In API Manager, via *Manage API*, import the API that was published to Exchange.
. In API Manager, add a rate-limiting SLA tier to the newly imported API. 
. Open Exchange from API Manager.
. In Exchange, create a client application for the API via the *Request Access* UI. 
+ 
API Manager is notified that a client application has requested access, and will automatically accept the request, thereby creating a contract.
. In Design Center, configure Mocking Service for the API.
+
With the mocking service configured, you can test the mocked API in a tool such as `curl`, or you can test the mocked API in Exchange.

== Basic Concepts
=== Applications
Applications are packages that integrate connectors, modules, and components. An application's main purpose is to read, write, and process data. Typically, applications read data from internal and external sources, process and transform data to the required formats or structures, and write output to the systems and servers where you store or use the transformed data. You build applications with Anypoint Studio.

Applications are also referred to as:

* Mule Applications
* Mule Runtime Engine Applications
* Client Applications
* Developer Client Applications
* Integration Applications

=== Security
==== Policies
Policies enable you to enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve adaptability of your APIs. For example, a policy can control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA).

API Manager supports the following types of policies:

* Default Policies
* Automated Policies
* Custom Policies

==== SLA Tiers
Service Level Access (SLA) tiers are categories of user access that you define for an API. The tier definition combined with an SLA-based policy determines whether access to the API at a certain level requires your approval. The tier definition also can limit the number of requests an application can make to the API. To enforce SLA tiers, you need to apply a rate-limiting or throttling policy that is SLA-based.

==== Client Providers (Identity Providers)
Client providers authorize client applications.

==== Contracts
As the Organization Administrator, after you grant access to applications in Exchange, a contract is automatically created between the API instance and the application. The contract gives access to the application based on SLA tiers that you might specify. Only one contract can exist per API instance and application at any time.

==== API Alerts
An API alert (different from a Runtime Manager alert) is an alarm that flags one of the following:

* The API request violates a policy
* Requests received by the API exceed a given number within a period of time
* The API returns a specified HTTP error code
* The API response time exceeds a certain amount

API Manager triggers alerts when states change from desirable to undesirable or vice versa. When an alert triggers, API Manager sends email notifications to you and to others, if configured.

=== API Analytics
API Analytics can provide insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. From API Manager, you can access the Analytics dashboard, create a custom dashboard, create and manage charts, and create reports.

=== API Assets
API assets, published by Exchange, are the components that comprise applications. Components include any of the following:

* APIs (OAS, RAML, RAML fragments, HTTP, WSDL, and Custom)
* API Groups
* Policies
* Examples
* Templates
* Modules
* Connectors owned by MuleSoft or your organization

=== API Groups
An API Group is an API asset that enables organizations to publish a group of API instances as a single unit, so that applications can access the APIs as a group using one client ID and, optionally, client secret. API Groups are created in Anypoint API Manager and published to Exchange.

=== API Instances
Instances of an API can exist in multiple environments. Additionally, you can create multiple instances of an API in the same environment.

You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy, with applied caching policies. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint, with applied throttling policies and security policies.

The API Manager dashboard shows key information about a deployed API instance:

=== Autodiscovery Schemes
Through the Autodiscovery scheme, API Manager can track the API throughout the life cycle as you modify, version, deploy, govern, and publish it.

=== Business Groups
A system administrator groups individuals within an organization into business groups. Each group has its own Exchange API assets, and its own environments.

=== Environments
Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications. These environments are independent from each other and enable you to test your applications under the same conditions as your production environment.

The support for environments in strategic components of Anypoint Platform eliminates the need to construct version names to reflect an environment. Restricting access to and managing environments is also simplified. Permissions to access APIs are environment-based.

== Hello World
The following procedure describes how to import an Exchange API asset into API Manager, and how to apply a proxy. The procedure assumes that you have already created an API and have published the API to Exchange.

. Once logged in to API Manager, click the environment control and switch to an environment that includes your API.
. Click *Manage API*.
. API Manager manages APIs from Exchange, or you can import APIs in a ZIP file from the file system. For this procedure, select *Manage API from Exchange*.
. In the *Manage API from Exchange* view, type the name of your API next to the *API Name* label and select the API from the dropdown list. The remaining text fields should auto-populate with your API configuration details.
+

. Next to *Managing type* select *Basic Endpoint*.
+
Placeholder text to explain the difference between Basic Endpoints and Endpoints with Proxy.
. Click *Save* to finish configuring the API. 
+
Since the API is unprotected, you can now perform management tasks like applying policies, setting up SLA tiers, assigning permissions to the API environment, versioning, viewing API analytics, and more. 
+
As an example, you'll apply the *Simple security manager* proxy. 
. Click *API Management* from the left-hand menu to return to the API dashboard.
. Expand the imported API and click its version.
+
Placeholder for screenshot
. Click *Policies* from the left-hand menu.
. Click *Apply New Policy*.
. Scroll down to and select *Simple security manager*.
+
The *Simple security manager* is a "fake" security manager than can only authenticate a single user. Real-world deployments would make use of more robust security policies, such as *OAuth 2.0 provider*.
. Click *Configure Policy*.
. Accept the default *Username* and *Password* and click *Apply*.

== FAQs
=== Why aren't rate-limiting SLA tiers enforced when testing against the mocking service?

// API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing APIs. As an Anypoint Platform user, you might be familiar with environments in the context of deploying APIs. In API Manager 2.x, a tight integration of Anypoint Platform components extends the use of environments in Runtime Manager to API management. The support for environments in strategic components of Anypoint Platform eliminates the need to construct version names to reflect an environment. Restricting access to and managing environments is also simplified. Permissions to access APIs are environment-based.

// In API Manager 2.x, you can use instances of an API in multiple environments, and you can have multiple instances in the same environment. You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint. You can apply caching policies, for example to the proxy, and throttling policies and security policies to the basic endpoint.

// Through the Autodiscovery scheme, API Manager can track the API throughout the life cycle as you modify, version, deploy, govern, and publish it. API Manager 2.x is tightly integrated with the following tools:

// * Design Center for creating the RAML structure of the API
// +
// The API design capabilities of Design Center replace the Jul 2017 API Designer tool in Anypoint Platform.
// +
// * Exchange for storing and publishing API assets
// +
// Assets are components, such as API versions, templates, and connectors owned by MuleSoft or your organization.
// +
// * Studio for implementing the API
// +
// API changes made in Studio are synchronized using Autodiscovery with the API registered in other tools, such as Design Center and API Manager.

// API Manager manages APIs that reside in Exchange or imports the APIs in a ZIP file from the file system. The ZIP is an API object that you exported from API Manager. You set up the API for RAML, HTTP, or WSDL management.

// * RAML/OAS for REST APIs
// +
// Provide the REST API Markup Language source, which you can write using Design Center.
// +
// * HTTP for REST APIs without a specified spec (RAML or OAS)
// +
// Provide the URL of the inbound HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.
// +
// * WSDL for SOAP APIs
// +
// Provide the URL where Anypoint Platform can find Web Services Definition Language source.

// After configuring the API, you can perform API management tasks, applying policies and setting up SLA tiers, assigning permissions to the API environment,
// versioning, viewing API analytics, and more.

// The API dashboard shows key information about a deployed API instance:

// API Manager leverages the runtime capabilities of API Gateway, which enforces policies, collects and tracks analytics data, manages proxies, provides industry standard encryption and authentications, and manages client applications. API Gateway is built into the Mule Runtime and ensures that proxies and policies are interconnected between Runtime Manager, API Manager, and the Mule Runtime. API Gateway points to the backend APIs and services that you define and abstracts them into a layer that your API management solution can utilise. For more information, see "API Gateway: Why you need flexible deployment" below.

// == API Manager Crowd Release

// API Manager 2.x (Crowd) was released in Nov 2017. If you create an Anypoint Platform account after the November release, you use API Manager 2.x to manage APIs as described in this documentation. Otherwise, switch to API Manager 1.x documentation using the dropdown at the top of this page.

// If you have the November 2017 release, use Design Center to author and update RAML specifications. Deployment to CloudHub occurs automatically as you design an API in Design Center. To deploy an API proxy to other servers, you can use API Manager. In API manager, you govern how users access the API through policies and SLA tiers.

// Note: Only API Manager 2.x can manage Mule 4 APIs.
