API Manager is a component of Anypoint Platform for managing, governing, and securing APIs. The component leverages the runtime capabilities of API Gateway, which enforces policies, collects and tracks analytics data, manages proxies, provides industry standard encryption and authentications, and manages applications.

== Anypoint Platform Components

API Manager is tightly integrated with the following tools:

* Design Center for specifying the structure of the API
* Exchange for storing and publishing API assets
* Studio for implementing the API
+
Using Autodiscovery, API changes made in Studio are synchronized with the API registered in other tools, such as Design Center and API Manager.

The life cycle of an API involves configuration and deployment, management, and engaging users. The following diagram depicts the workflow:

== API Manager Overview

Logging in to Anypoint Platform and selecting *API Manager* from the main menu navigates you to the following page:

image::api-manager-ui-overview.png[80%,80%]

<1> The environment selector is displayed at the top left of the API Administration page.
+
Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications. 
+
For details, see xref:switch-environment-task.adoc[Switching Environments].
<2> You can select an option from the left navigation menu:
** *API Groups*
+
An API Group is an API asset that enables organizations to publish a group of API instances as a single unit. 
+
For details, see xref:api-groups-landing-page.adoc[API Groups].
** *Automated Policies* 
+
With policy automation, API owners can quickly design, build, and deploy secure and consistent APIs. 
+
For details, see xref:automated-policies-landing-page.adoc[Automated Policies].
** *Client Applications*
+
Applications are packages that integrate connectors, modules, and components. 
+
For details, see xref:view-api-contracts.adoc[View API Instance Contracts].
** *Custom Policies*
+
Custom Policies are policies that anyone can develop and apply to their APIs, with the intention of extending existing functionality or defining new functionality. 
+
For details, see xref:custom-policy-getting-started.adoc[Getting started with Custom Policies development].
** *Analytics*
+
API Analytics can provide insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. 
+
For details, see xref:viewing-api-analytics.adoc[Reviewing Analytics Usage].
<3> The *Manage API* button enables you to add APIs.
+
You can add an API previously published to Exchange. Or you can add an API by uploading a RAML/OAS/SOAP definition. Additionally you can add an API by importing an existing configuration ZIP file.
+
For details, see xref:getting-started-proxy.adoc[Getting Started with Managing an API].
<4> Click the *Promote from environment* button to promote an API from any environment to the current environment. 
+
For details, see xref:promote-api-task.adoc[Promoting an API Instance to Another Environment]. 
<5> Search for managed APIs via the API search field.
+
Searches are case-sensitive. Filter search results by selecting *All*, *Favorites* or *Active*.
<6> Click the *Environment information* button to display a dialog with information about the current environment, such as environment credentials.
+
You can use environement credentials to provision the Anypoint Service Mesh adapter, or to configure Studio to sync with your environment.
<7> The API version is displayed for each API. 
+
Clicking the API version number navigates you to the API *Settings* view, where you can manage the following:
+
** *Alerts*
+
For details, see xref:using-api-alerts.adoc[Reviewing Alerts Concepts].
** *Contracts*
+
For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].
** *Policies*
+
For details, see xref:api-proxy-landing-page.adoc[API Proxy].
** *SLA Tiers*
+
For details, see xref:defining-sla-tiers.adoc[Reviewing SLA Tiers Concepts].
<8> The registration status of each API is displayed.
+
Possible values are *Active*, *Inactive*, and *Unregistered*. 
+
A status of *Unregistered* means that Anypoint Platform has never tracked the endpoint for this API version. Either you have entered a URL for an API or proxy that is not yet deployed, or you have declared an endpoint that is hosted somewhere other than an API Gateway and need to proxy that endpoint so that the platform can track it.
+
The endpoint must be tracked *Active* by Anypoint Platform in order for governance policies and SLA tiers to function. 
<9> The number of contracted client applications is displayed for each API.
+
For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].


== API Manager Basic Concepts

=== Policies
Policies enable you to enforce regulations to help manage security, control traffic, and improve adaptability of your APIs. For example, a policy can control authentication, access, allotted consumption, and service level access (SLA).

API Manager supports the following types of policies:

* Default Policies
* Automated Policies
* Custom Policies

For details, see xref:api-proxy-landing-page.adoc[API Proxy].

=== SLA Tiers
Service Level Access (SLA) tiers are categories of user access that you define for an API. The tier definition combined with an SLA-based policy determines whether access to the API at a certain level requires your approval. The tier definition also can limit the number of requests an application can make to the API. To enforce SLA tiers, you need to apply a rate-limiting or throttling policy that is SLA-based.

For details, see xref:defining-sla-tiers.adoc[Reviewing SLA Tiers Concepts].

=== Client Providers (Identity Providers)
You can use client providers to help you enforce security and regulations in your business organization. Client providers authorize client applications. 

For details, see xref:configure-multiple-credential-providers.adoc[Configure Multiple Client Providers for Client Management].

=== Contracts
As the Organization Administrator, after you grant access to applications in Exchange, a contract is automatically created between the API instance and the application. The contract gives access to the application based on SLA tiers that you might specify. Only one contract can exist per API instance and application at any time.

For details, see xref:api-contracts-landing-page.adoc[Client Applications and Contracts].

=== API Alerts
An API alert (different from a Runtime Manager alert) is an alarm that flags one of the following:

* The API request violates a policy
* Requests received by the API exceed a given number within a period of time
* The API returns a specified HTTP error code
* The API response time exceeds a certain amount

API Manager triggers alerts when states change from desirable to undesirable or vice versa. When an alert triggers, API Manager sends email notifications to you and to others, if configured.

For details, see xref:using-api-alerts.adoc[Reviewing Alerts Concepts].

=== Applications
Applications are packages that integrate connectors, modules, and components. An application's main purpose is to read, write, and process data. Typically, applications read data from internal and external sources, process and transform data to the required formats or structures, and write output to the systems and servers where you store or use the transformed data. You build applications with Anypoint Studio.

Applications are also referred to as:

* Mule Applications
* Mule Runtime Engine Applications
* Client Applications
* Developer Client Applications
* Integration Applications

=== API Analytics
API Analytics can provide insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. From API Manager, you can access the Analytics dashboard, create a custom dashboard, create and manage charts, and create reports.

For details, see xref:viewing-api-analytics.adoc[Reviewing Analytics Usage].

=== API Assets
API assets, published by Exchange, are the components that comprise applications. Components include any of the following:

* APIs (OAS, RAML, RAML fragments, HTTP, WSDL, and Custom)
* API Groups
* Policies
* Examples
* Templates
* Modules
* Connectors owned by MuleSoft or your organization

=== API Groups
An API Group is an API asset that enables organizations to publish a group of API instances as a single unit, so that applications can access the APIs as a group using one client ID and, optionally, client secret. API Groups are created in Anypoint API Manager and published to Exchange.

For details, see xref:api-groups-landing-page.adoc[API Groups].

=== API Instances
Instances of an API can exist in multiple environments. Additionally, you can create multiple instances of an API in the same environment.

You can create one instance of an API that serves as a proxy, with applied caching policies. You can create another to manage directly as a basic endpoint, with applied throttling policies and security policies.

The API Manager dashboard shows key information about a deployed API instance:

image::dashboard-legend.png[]

For details, see xref:api-instance-landing-page.adoc[API Instance].

=== Autodiscovery Schemes
Through the Autodiscovery scheme, API Manager can track the API throughout the life cycle as you modify, version, deploy, govern, and publish it.

=== Business Groups
A system administrator groups individuals within an organization into business groups. Each group has its own Exchange API assets, and its own environments.

=== Environments
Anypoint Platform enables you to create and manage separate deployment environments for APIs and applications. These environments are independent from each other and enable you to test your applications under the same conditions as your production environment.

The support for environments in strategic components of Anypoint Platform eliminates the need to construct version names to reflect an environment. Restricting access to and managing environments is also simplified. Permissions to access APIs are environment-based.

For details, see xref:environments-concept.adoc[Reviewing Environment Concepts].
