After the user xref:exchange::to-request-access.adoc[requests access] to your API instance from Exchange, you can manually approve or reject a request from API Manager if you have configured the SLA tier for the application for manual approvals.

To approve or reject requests for accessing an API:

. In API Manager, click *API Administration*.
. Click the API Name of the API instance that you need to access. 
. Click the `<api version>:<api instance>` link, for example, "v1:16046365". 
. From the configuration page for the API instance, click *Contracts* from the left menu.

The request appears:

. To approve the request, click *Approve*.
. Alternatively, you can click *Reject* if you do not want to give access to your API instance to the requesting application.
