|===

The Header Removal policy removes all listed headers from a request or a response of a message. When you configure this policy for your API, you must specify an inbound and outbound map of the headers that you want to remove from the message processing in the form of a key-value pair.

You can optionally include DataWeave expressions for Mule 4.0 and Mule runtime engine (Mule) expressions for Mule 3.0 and in the value of the header:

`“#[attributes.requestPath]”`

In this example, all the headers matching the configured expression are removed from the message.


== How This Policy Works

Every header matching an expression that you specify in the policy parameter is removed from a message. Therefore, you must double-check your expression for the header removal.

For example, the `content-type` and `content-length` headers and the host header of a request can be filtered by this policy. In the response, only the `content-type` header is removed:

.Inbound Header

.Outbound Header
