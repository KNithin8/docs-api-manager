As a DataGraph manager, you can ensure that only authorized client applications can consume the graph. Access is granted by credentials and SLA tier.

.The illustration shows the DataGraph Contracts page.

The DataGraph Contracts page lists client applications that have requested access, client applications you've approved, and client applications whose contracts you have been revoked. To get additional information about a client application, click the *>* icon next to the application's name.

Client applications request access to a graph via Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). Approving access creates a contract between the client application and the graph instance and registers the client application.
