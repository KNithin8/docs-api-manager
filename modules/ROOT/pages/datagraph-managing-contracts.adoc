As a DataGraph manager, you can ensure that only authorized client applications can consume the graph. Access is granted by credentials and SLA tier.

.The illustration shows the DataGraph Contracts page.

Listed are client applications that have requested access, client applications that are approved, and client applications whose contracts have been revoked. Clicking the chevron next to a client application name shows additional information about the application.

Client applications request access to a graph via Anypoint Exchange (Exchange). Approving access creates a contract between the client application and the graph instance, and the client application is registered.
